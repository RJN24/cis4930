The class project for Advanced Python

The goal of this application is help children strengthen their fraction skills by both practicing problems and checking their solutions. 

The app will consist of the following components:
## Fraction Solver 
* This feature allows the student to type in any fraction and their result will be printed.

## Fraction Practice
* Here we will be providing the student with fraction problems and they will be typing in the answers. We will determine whether the answer is correct or incorrect. 

## Reduction Practice
* We will give an unreduced fraction, and the user needs to reduce the fraction to the lowest form. 

## Progress Report
* We will display the results of the practice session for this student, to see their progress, possibly in chart form.

## Individual login
* Each user will be allowed to create their own account and log in, to keep track of their personal progress.
