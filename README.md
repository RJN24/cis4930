The class project for Advanced Python

The goal of this website is help children strengthen their fraction skills by both practicing problems and checking their solutions. 

The website will consist of the following components:
*1. Fraction Solver? - This feature allows the student to type in any fraction and their result will be printed.
*2. Fraction Practice? - Here we will be providing the student with fraction problems and they will be typing in the answers. We will determine whether the answer is correct or incorrect. 
**Level 1 - Fractions will have the same denominator, making the problem very easy for addition and subtraction cases.
**Level 2 - Different denominators will be provided.
**Level 3 - Two digits fractions will be provided.
**1 point awarded for correct and reduced answer.
**0.5 point for correct but unreduced answer
**0 points for incorrect answer.
*3. Reduction Practice? - We will give an unreduced fraction, and the user needs to reduce the fraction to the lowest form. 
**1 point awarded for correct and reduced answer.
**0.5 point for correct but unreduced answer
**0 points for incorrect answer.
*4. Progress Report? - We will display the results of the practice session for this student, to see their progress, possibly in chart form.
*5. Individual login? - Each user will be allowed to create their own account and log in, to keep track of their personal progress.
